# DCGAN-based-Image-synthesis

This is an experimental tensorflow implementation of synthesizing images. The images are synthesized using the GAN-CLS Algorithm from the paper [Generative Adversarial Network ImageSynthesis][1]. 



## Requirements
- [TensorFlow] 1.0+

## Datasets
- The model is currently trained on the famous Fashion-MNIST.



## Codes
- `DCGAN.pynb` training the model.
- `plot_utils.py` helper functions for plotting Images.
